# Product leader things

This is a living document to collect resources related to product design and management. Please suggest any additions.

# Purpose

This guide is a reference that is building over time. I work as head of product for a tech company, prior to which founded a SaaS company that spun out of a major technology company powering your computer or device right now. I want to learn, share, and learn some more together. Pull requests for any additions to this are encouraged.
